The script 'publish.js' performs find and replace operations on the JavaScript
files output by Adobe Animate 20.0.4 to enable these animations to work with the
plea bargain simulation and to make asset customization possible.

This repository should contain the most up-to-date version of 'publish.js' which
is a dependency of the researcher console. Include this repository as a git
submodule under 'server/common/' of the console.

Originally, this was a pipeline of Bash scripts which were run on '*.js' files
before manually packaging them into a simulation. At that time, the simulation
code had to be modified heavily for each study. Later, the script was rewritten
in Python, still to be run manually, but now compatible with structural changes
made by Adobe to the JavaScript files exported by Animate. These scripts no
longer generate the format required by the researcher console, which
automatically runs 'publish.js' on each file upload and handles packaging the
files with the simulation. For reference, these older scripts can be found under
'archived/'.
